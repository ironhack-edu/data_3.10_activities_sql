# 3.10 Activity 2

Use the `get_loans()` function that you created in the previous activity and:

1. Compute how many loans you have belonging to each possible status label (don't clean the dataframe)
2. Use `sns.countplot()` to create a bar plot showing the class imbalance
3. Create a Python function named `eval_CI()` with two inputs: a dataframe and a column name and returns a dataframe having as column names the possible labels of the input column, and as values, the CI of each label considering a `One vs rest` approach
4. Create a Python function named `eval_CI2()` with two inputs: a dataframe and a column name and returns a dataframe having as column names all the possible **UNIQUE** pairs of labels (CI is anti-symmetrical under label exchange) of the input column, and as values the CI of each pair of labels
